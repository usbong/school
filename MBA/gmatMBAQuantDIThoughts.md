# GMAT ALL THE QUANT + DI

## Thoughts

1) It's faster to solve a problem that you've seen prior. The hardest problems are the ones that you've never seen before.

2) The questions in the exam are geared toward how the people who designed them wanted them answered. They could create an exam that most people wouldn't even be able to figure out unless #1. Rule makers.

3) The questions whose answers I couldn't immediately figure out are like annoying programming problems that I could eventually solve in exchange for time. Why is it not working?!

4) Learning about faster ways to solving a problem feels amazing, except for #2.

5) I'd recommend people to really do all the exercises in the book. It's a lot more interactive that way, although the writings in some of the images are too small, even after setting the Kindle eBook Reader's layout to "Single Column."

## More Thoughts

1) I've been continuing with the GMAT review despite the noise.
  
2) There's something to learn each day.

3) The reviewer itself teaches something about the actual world.

### Examples

1) Are you interested in learning about topics that would only have a small chance of getting included in the actual MBA exam?

2) Do you want to learn more about a topic because you want to understand how something became what it is?

3) This exam is baloney, unless you’re the one who made it?!
