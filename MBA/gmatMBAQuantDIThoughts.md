## Thoughts

1) It's faster to solve a problem that you've seen prior. The hardest problems are the ones that you've never seen before.

2) The questions in the exam are geared toward how the people who designed them wanted them answered. They could create an exam that most people wouldn't even be able to figure out unless #1. Rule makers.

3) The questions whose answers I couldn't immediately figure out are like annoying programming problems that I could eventually solve in exchange for time. Why is it not working?!

4) Learning about faster ways to solving a problem feels amazing, except for #2.

5) I'd recommend people to really do all the exercises in the book. It's a lot more interactive that way, although the writings in some of the images are too small, even after setting the Kindle eBook Reader's layout to "Single Column."
